Python Library
==============

The PSLab Python library provides programmatic access to PSLab boards on PCs.
It is also the backend to the [PSLab desktop app](../desktop/Readme.html).

The sources are on [GitHub](http://github.com/fossasia/pslab-python).

**Note for older Windows systems**

PSLab is using a CP2102N USB serial adapter. You may need to install the driver
from the [Silicon Labs website](https://www.silabs.com/software-and-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).
